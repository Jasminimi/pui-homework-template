## Feedback Summary

The critique of my portfolio website provided valuable insights regarding several key aspects of its design and content. A significant concern raised was about my landing page, which currently only showcases my first project without presenting a clear main page. This could potentially create an impression of incompleteness. To address this, reviewers suggested adding a popup window with an "About Me" section, which would enhance user engagement and provide visitors with important context about my background and expertise.

For my recycling information tool, the feedback emphasized the necessity for localized data specific to Pittsburgh. Reviewers encouraged me to ensure that the data is not only available but also accurate, highlighting the importance of addressing potential questions users might have when interacting with the tool. Additionally, they recommended incorporating scenario-based problem-solving features to improve user interactivity.

Lastly, the feedback regarding my sleep management tool pointed out the need for better organization within the interface. Critics suggested featuring the calculator prominently on the main page, while relocating resources and reviews to a menu. Implementing these changes will help streamline the user experience across my projects.

## Feedback Digestion

The critique of my portfolio website provided valuable insights, particularly regarding the landing page's focus on my first project without a clear main page. This feedback highlighted the importance of creating a comprehensive view of my work, which is essential for users to navigate easily. As a result, I am considering adding a popup window with an "About Me" section to enhance user engagement. This addition would not only give visitors insight into my background and expertise but also set the context for my projects.

In terms of my recycling information tool, the suggestion for localized data specific to Pittsburgh resonated with me. Reviewers emphasized the necessity of ensuring users have access to accurate and relevant information while also considering the questions they might have when using the tool. While I recognize the value of integrating scenario-based problem-solving features for enhanced interactivity, I have decided to prioritize updates to my portfolio first.

Similarly, the feedback for my sleep management tool pointed to the need for better organization. I agree with the suggestion to make the calculator more prominent on the main page, which will serve as the focal point of the user experience. Overall, these critiques provide a clear roadmap for improvement, and I am excited to implement the changes to my portfolio website, as they will significantly enhance the user experience.
